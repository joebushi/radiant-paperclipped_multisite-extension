= Paperclip Multisite

This extension scopes assets to sites. With spanner's multi_site fork it's just a one-liner: you could accomplish the same thing by adding this to the Asset model in paperclipped:

  is_site_scoped if defined? Site
  
But without some recurring conditionals that does rather bork your tests.

With any luck this will one day become standard.
