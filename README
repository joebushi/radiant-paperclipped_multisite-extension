= Paperclip Multisite

This extension scopes assets to sites. Spanner's fork of multi-site is needed. It does most of the work in the model (by putting a scope around find, essentially), so there are no controller modifications required and we can shrink this to a couple of lines.

You could probably get rid of this extension altogether by adding this to Asset:

  is_site_scoped if defined? Site && Radiant::Config['assets.scoped?']

But the conditionality does make your tests a bit more tangled.

Some very simple tests are included here to make sure that Asset loads and is properly scoped.
